About the Project
CervixCare Predictor is designed to predict the survival period for patients using various clinical and demographic data. The application uses several machine learning models to provide accurate predictions and supports an interactive and user-friendly interface.

Features
Interactive User Interface: Easy-to-use interface for inputting patient data.
Multiple Models: Choose from Decision Tree, SVR, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and ANN models.
Visualization: Visualize input data dynamically.
Customizable: Easily extendable for additional features and data inputs.
Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or later
Git
Installation
Clone the repo

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/streamlit-app.git
cd streamlit-app
Install Python packages

Install the required packages using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app

sh
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 (or the URL provided by Streamlit).
Enter the patient's data into the respective fields.
Select the prediction model from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted survival period.
Models and Evaluation
The following machine learning models are implemented in this application:

Decision Tree
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Each model is trained and evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. The model scores are displayed in the console during training.
